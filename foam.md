# Foam

- [[go]]https://github.com/foambubble/foam/
- [x] sub-module for private garden.
  **CANNOT BE DONE**, gh-jekyll [complains "The submodule registered for `./Walls` could not be cloned. Make sure it's using https:// and that it's a public repo.  See https://docs.github.com/en/github/working-with-github-pages/troubleshooting-jekyll-build-errors-for-github-pages-sites#invalid-submodule"](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#inbox/FMfcgxwLsmclCJcnvjwfLBGQCrWCPvjz).
- [ ] retrofit `foam` to run with [[restructured-text]] (not just Markdown),
  see [foambubble/foam#474](https://github.com/foambubble/foam/issues/474).
