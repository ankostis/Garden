# My Garden setup

Sensitive information is stored in a "walled garden", an encrypted keybase git-submodule.
But couldn't [combine existing repo with it](https://delitescere.medium.com/combining-an-existing-git-repo-with-keybase-encrypted-git-2841609166f0),
due to GitHub's jekyll complains, as explained in [[foam]].
So it has to happen in 2 steps: clone and attach submodule locally only.

## Walled Garden

Command to attach my walled Garden:

```bash
git submodule add -f keybase://private/ankostis/GardenWall Walls
```

The `-f` is needed because `.gitmodules` is in `.gitignore`,
for it must not be pushed to GitHub repo.
