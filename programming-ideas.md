# Programming Ideas

## Hypothesis

- extend client:
  - read from multiple API-sources
  - read tags from API (not just from cache)
  - integrate with [[web-clipper]]
  - integrate with [foam's wikilinks](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1h2kSuh7TntPj_XZ7BnLPDwtwshq7skzF3BIYwLgVquA/edit)
  - retrofit discussion threads to follow [[kialo]]
- clone and adapt API-server to support plugins for fetching personal notes
  for some url from:
  - `twitter`
  - `slack`
  - `discord`
  - `reddit`
  - `gmail`: fetch also tags
  - `keep` 
  - ...
  - [page flags]() for:
    - github issues (authored & commented)
    - chrome & firefox plugins (to know you have installed them)
  - AND/OR use [[promensia]] browser extension (requires a lot of python configuration)
  - see also: [[Agora Bridge]]
  - see also [`HPI` library](https://github.com/karlicoss/HPI)
  
## Personal Knowledge Database

- integrate [[foam]]+[[web-clipper]]+[Polar Bookshelf](https://github.com/burtonator/)
  - scan my web-annotations with `PKDB.todo` and download offline
  - see https://github.com/burtonator/polar-bookshelf/issues/682
