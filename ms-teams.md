# MS-teams

## Short-commings

- Cannot save links (bookmarks)
- Cannot open more app windows
- Cannot hold 2 or more chats/channels viewable side by side
- Cannot scroll to the last posts with a button from mobile
  (hindering long posts, since clicking the link of past replies gets you at the top)

## Short-commings vs Slack, Zulip

- Only the author can edit OP
- not FOSS
- API hard to use (for bots/automations)
- ECAS blocks all integrations with other EC IT-systems

## Channel-vs-topics per feature saga

### Channels

- listed in left-sidebar:
  - easy to retrieve old stuff when deciding where to post
  - possible to pin & hide, thus 3 levels of visibility
- notifications:
  - by default turned-off, so new topics do not bother us all
- Cannot explicitly hide/archive old discussions
- analytics are channel-only:
  - may function as calendar/time-tracking about features

### Topic

- old discussions are implicitly "archived" (pushed back)
- can emulate TOCs with *pinned posts* and the *(i)* right-sidebar
