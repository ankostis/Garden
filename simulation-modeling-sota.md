## Programs

- [[SimPy]] - library & components for building event-based simulators
- [[ml-flow]] - model management platform

  - a paper about it[ml-experiment: A Python framework for reproducible data science](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/345369293_ml-experiment_A_Python_framework_for_reproducible_data_science)
  - [medium-blog](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-use-mlflow-on-aws-to-better-track-machine-learning-experiments-bbcb8acded65)
  - Reminds me of Pachyderm's mission, but oriented to modelling
  - Seems match [[co2mpas]] calibrate & apply functionality
- [[bms]] - *Block Model Simulator (BMSpy)*: simulink for Python, mostly for automotive,
  has even WLTP signals!
