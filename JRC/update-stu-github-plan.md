# Update STU GitHub Plan

* Assigned: 28 Jan, via telegram  
* Delivered: 10 Feb, via telegram & [email](https://mail.google.com/mail/u/0/#sent/KtbxLvHXDGjJBGnnwBXcmSHFgJcJhvzdgq)
* Charged: 0.5 day (so far)

## 1st evaluation of the situation

  * [GitHub Support#1011157](https://support.github.com/ticket/personal/0/1011157#tc-1398989753172)
  * if we downgrade to [Team Free Plan](https://github.com/organizations/plan):
    * we get infinite private repos(!)
    * lose support tickets (2nd or 3rd time we used them )
    * Private repos lose many features, eg:
      * wikis (we use that in co2mpas and DICE), 
      * multiple assignees (we use that in co2mpas)
      * code-review versatility (not extensively used it)
      * github-pages(none used, but nice for semi-static sites)
  * if we switch to Team Plan (4$ * 23 = 96/month!):
    * private-repos features are preserved
    * "standard" support (not just "community)
  * In any case, we don't lose any LFS packages.
  * I can only perform the downgrade (or anyone assigned as "billing manager"),
    but not the new plan, because _aÂ new credit-card_ is needed when registering.

Hi Kostis,

Thanks for writing in. We're only able to provide support via email, so I can confirm that we haven't called you.

Our pricing model was updated to provide access to private repositories, along with a number of new features with our Free subscription.

> Can we convert to the Pro 4$/month?

No, our Pro subscription is available for use with your personal user account, but cannot be used by an organization.

> What would we lose if we go for the free-plan?

I would consider an important loss to be access to email support, as you would instead need to consult our GitHub Community forum for help in the future. For a more complete list of features available with our Free subscription, I'd recommend viewing our pricing page:

> We have an LFS support,  
> is this included in the Pro plan?

No, LFS data packs are not included with any of our subscriptions, but are available with any account at a cost of $5 per month, per data pack. As of now, the **JRCSTU** organization account has a single data pack in place, which would remain no mattter the subscription in place for that organization.

If you would like to move to our Free subscription in the future, any administrator or billing manager can follow these steps:

Hope this helps! If we can provide more information or help in some other way just let us know.

All the best,

Hi there,

Thanks for writing in. Moving to our Team subscription would cause an immediate charge attempt
to process for that change. It's of note that moving to Team today would require 23 paid seats,
so a charge of $92 would be processed.

If we can help in some other way just let us know.

All the best,
