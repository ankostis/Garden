# Well-being and Motivation at work

## Motivation

My priorities is this:

- Joy: play, challenging tasks
- Mastery: knowledge and information about what preceeded me, hitory of everything, planetary to family
- Achievement: actually mymotivation diminishes as i come closer to achievment
- Purpose: general political & ideological targets
- Avoidance of danger for family

Like working on new issues but echeving more when working in comfort zone,
which reduces my total motivation (due to repetition)
