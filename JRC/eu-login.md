# EU-Login (ECAS)

## Woes

- It's slow.
- Redirections after the page has expire do not work
  (ask you for email and respond with "You are now logged in to EU Login.")
- Recent authentications do not grant full set of permissions
  (so re-auth is immediately needed if a site needs a separate permission)
- Unstable gitlab access
